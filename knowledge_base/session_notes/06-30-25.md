# Session [40] - Duskryn Does a Full Anakin (and We're All Screwed)
Date: 2025-06-30

## Summary
The party found themselves locked in the Theater of Blood, deep in debate over whether Duskryn should give up his Eldarith to Ghul'Vor, the ex-god of darkness. Despite divine warnings of "failure," Duskryn proceeded with the catastrophic Black Benediction ritual, resulting in his soul being trapped in a mirror and his body nearly killed, forcing the party to choose whether to enter a cosmic rift to save him.

## Key Events
- Elarion's divination revealed "failure" if the deal with Ghul'Vor proceeded
- Duskryn cast Calm Emotions to pacify most of the party, preventing intervention
- The Black Benediction ritual was performed, infusing Duskryn's soul into a mirror
- Ghul'Vor killed Duskryn's body with an axe after the ritual
- Divine intervention from an angelic figure offered one chance to save Duskryn
- Ghul'Vor shattered the mirror, opening a reality rift that began pulling everything in
