# Session 41 - Into the Soul Cairn
Date: 2025-01-35 (Tuesday, Lunari)

## Summary
The party entered a cosmic rift to save Duskryn's soul from being consumed by soul leeches after Ghul'vor the Undying completed the Black Benediction ritual. Inside a Soul Cairn—a liminal space between life and death—they faced a Soul Harvester and its minions while attempting to solve a color-coded lantern puzzle. Meanwhile, Duskryn experienced powerful memories from his past as his soul weakened with each passing moment, trapped within a dark red crystalline bloom.

## Duskryn's Current State
- **Physical Body**: Lifeless corpse carried by Pork
  - Large gash wound across the top of neck
  - Deep puncture wound in chest (from Eldarith)
  - Skin turned from lively gray to sullen and dark
  - Beard drenched in his own blood
  - Chain mail frayed and cracked
- **Soul**: Trapped in dark red crystal rose at center of Soul Cairn
  - Semi-transparent, flickering like a dying flame
  - Starting HP: 17 (rolled poorly on d100)
  - Current HP: 12 (after soul leech draining)
  - Losing 4 HP per round to soul leeches
  - Can perceive the battlefield around him

## The Black Benediction Incident
- Duskryn willingly gave his Eldarith to Ghul'vor despite warnings
- Ignored divination result of "failure" from Dharuri (old gods)
- Claimed he was acting of his own free will, not under Ghul'vor's control
- Ghul'vor drove the Eldarith directly into Dusk's chest, severing body from soul
- Dusk's soul was pulled into a mirror and bound within it
- Ritual was meant to:
  - Unseat the wielder of an Eldarith
  - Consume the soul of a worthy servant
  - Help elevate Ghul'Vors's divine status

## Ethernea's Intervention
- **Appearance**: Angelic figure who broke into Ghul'vor's dimension
  - Gray robes

  - Declared "Dusk's soul is not yet forsaken"
  - Said "the pact may yet be broken if those who are still would fight for him"
  - Pursued Ghul'vor when he fled
  - Created/revealed the rift to the Soul Cairn
- **Key Messages**:
  - "Beyond this gate lies Duskryn's soul"
  - "It drifts among fragments of his truth, some of it beautiful and yet some of it very painful"
  - "If you would save him, walk through"

## Cliffhanger/Next Session Hook
With Dusk's soul at 12 HP and losing 4 HP per round, time is running out. High Acolyte Aldric's spirit is entering the Soul Cairn. The party must solve the lantern puzzle while defending against waves of soul leeches. Dusk must ultimately choose whether to return—no one can force him.
