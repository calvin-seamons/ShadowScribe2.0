# Session [41] - Into the Soul Cairn
Date: 2025-08-06

## Summary
The party entered a cosmic rift to save Duskryn's soul from being consumed by soul leeches after Ghul'vor the Undying completed the Black Benediction ritual. Inside a Soul Cairn—a liminal space between life and death—they faced a Soul Harvester and its minions while attempting to solve a color-coded lantern puzzle.
