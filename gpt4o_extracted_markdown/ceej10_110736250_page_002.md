## ==== BLOOD HUNTER FEATURES ====

* **Hit Points - CR**

* **Proficiencies - CR**

* **Hunter's Bane - CR**

  You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track fey, fiends, or undead, and you have advantage on Intelligence ability checks to recall information about them.

* **Hemocraft Modifier: Wisdom • CR**

  Your Hemocraft DC is 16.

* **Blood Maledict - CR**

  You can invoke a blood curse a number of times per short rest based on your level. Before it affects the target, you can choose to amplify the curse. An amplified curse gains an additional effect noted in the curse's description. Amplifying a curse causes you to take 1d6 points of necrotic damage that cannot be reduced in any way.

  Creatures that don't have blood in their bodies are immune to blood curses, unless the curse has been amplified.

  | 1/2 / Short Rest - No Action |
  | ---------------------------- |
  | Your chosen Blood Curses for use with the Blood Maledict feature: |

  | Blood Curse of the Fallen Puppet • CR |

  | When a creature you can see within 30 ft. drops to 0 HP, you can use your reaction to have that creature make one weapon attack against a target of your choice within its range. |

  Amplify. You can first cause the cursed creature to move up to half its speed, and grant a +5 bonus to its attack roll.

  As a bonus action, you can activate any rite you know on a weapon you're holding. A weapon can only hold one active rite at a time. When activated, you take 1d6 necrotic damage which can't be reduced in any way.

  While your rite is in effect, attacks made with this weapon are magical and you deal an additional 1d6 damage of the type determined by the chosen rite. The rite's effect lasts until you finish a short/long rest and other creatures cannot gain the benefit of your rite.
