### Brand of Castigation - GR

Once per short/long rest, whenever you damage a creature with a weapon that has an active rite, you can sear an arcane brand on that creature. Your brand has the following effects:
- You always know the direction to the branded creature as long as it's on the same plane as you.
- Each time the branded creature deals damage to you or another creature you can see within 5 ft. of you, the branded creature takes 5 psychic damage.

Your brand lasts until you dismiss it or until you apply a brand to another creature. Your brand can be dispelled with dispel magic and is treated as a level 3 spell.

* **Mind Link - ERftLW**
