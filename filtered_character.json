One fateful day, the tranquility of Kluntul was shattered by the emergence of an exceptionally powerful and malevolent entity, known as Xurmurrin, The Voiceless One. Xurmurrin sought to plunge the realm into darkness, upsetting the delicate balance Ethernea had strived to maintain.\n\n**The Call to Arms**\n\nHigh Acolyte Aldric, recognizing the gravity of the threat, entrusted Duskryn with the command of a formidable battalion of Holy Knights. Their mission was clear: to defend the sacred land of Kluntul and to vanquish the Voiceless One. The battalion, inspired by Duskryn\u2019s unwavering faith and strategic acumen, marched towards the heart of the threat\u2014the Shadow's Edge, a place where the Veil between light and dark was weakest.\n\n**The Battle**\n\nAs they approached Shadow's Edge, the skies darkened, and an eerie silence enveloped the land. The air crackled with dark energy, a palpable sign of Xurmurrin's presence. Duskryn, standing at the forefront, raised his hammer high, invoking Ethernea's blessing. His presence radiated a calming light, instilling courage in his soldiers. The clash was fierce, with Xurmurrin's shadowy minions assailing the Holy Knights from all sides.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos, Duskryn found himself facing Xurmurrin directly. The Voiceless One's power was immense, a swirling vortex of darkness that threatened to consume everything. Drawing upon Ethernea's teachings, Duskryn channeled both light and dark magic, creating a barrier that shielded his troops and weakened Xurmurrin\u2019s attacks. The battle raged on, with neither side gaining a clear advantage.\n\n**The Turning Point**\n\nIn a desperate bid to tip the scales, Xurmurrin unleashed a devastating wave of dark energy, overwhelming the battalion. In that critical moment, Duskryn felt a surge of power within him, a gift from Ethernea herself. The mystical boundary of the Veil opened before him, revealing the secrets of balance. Embracing this newfound power, Duskryn unleashed a blinding light infused with shadows, a manifestation of Ethernea\u2019s essence. The force of this power obliterated Xurmurrin's minions and struck the Voiceless One with unparalleled intensity.\n\n**The Retreat**\n\nXurmurrin, weakened and vulnerable, saw his army fall before the might of Duskryn and the Holy Knights. Recognizing the futility of continued conflict, Xurmurrin retreated into the shadows, vowing to return and exact his revenge. The retreat of the Voiceless One sent ripples through the realm, disrupting the balance of light and darkness. The excessive power of light began to overwhelm the land, creating a new imbalance. Duskryn, realizing the consequences of their partial victory, vowed to restore the equilibrium that Ethernea so dearly cherished.\n\nReturning to Kluntul as a hero, Duskryn was lauded for his bravery and leadership. However, he knew that his true task had just begun. With the blessing and guidance of High Acolyte Aldric, Duskryn embarked on a new quest to restore the delicate balance between light and darkness, ensuring that Ethernea's legacy of harmony would endure.\n",
      "otherNotes": "Role in the Battle of Shadow's Edge: His significant role in this battle, where he led the Holy Knights against Xurmurrin, The Voiceless One, showcases his leadership and combat prowess. This event also granted him an impressive amount of power from Ethernea, reinforcing his commitment to maintaining balance.\n\nOngoing Vigilance: Duskryn remains ever-vigilant for signs of Xurmurrin\u2019s return, constantly preparing and strategizing to protect Kluntul from future threats. This vigilance can sometimes border on paranoia, affecting his interactions and decisions.\n\nConnection to the Veil: His experience with the Veil and the balance of light and darkness has given him unique insights and abilities. This connection might manifest in his magic or decision-making, influencing how he perceives and interacts with the world.\n\nMoral Dilemmas: His dedication to balance can lead to moral dilemmas, especially when situations arise that seem to favor one side over the other. This internal conflict can create tension and character development opportunities.\n\nReputation: Duskryn's reputation as a hero and leader in Kluntul means he is respected and possibly revered by many, but it also places a burden of expectation on him to always act in the realm's best interest."

To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell\u2019s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn\u2019t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.

As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature\u2019s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature\u2019s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature\u2019s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>\r\n<p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.</p>\r\n<p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can\u2019t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can\u2019t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn\u2019t speak any language.</p>\r\n<p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can\u2019t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>",
